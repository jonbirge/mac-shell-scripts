# mac-shell-scripts
Shell script interfaces to a few common Mac OS X apps. The goal is to allow one to ssh into their Mac OS X
computer remotely and quickly do a few things, such as check mail or look at their calendar.

- mail: replicate old UNIX mail command, showing unread mail
- from: show headers of mail, read or unread
- readall: mark all mail read
- things: show inbox and today from Things
- thing: add an item to inbox in Things
